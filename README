Experiment of switch-case in python3

There are several implementations in pypi.python.org, probably better than this experiment.


Usage:
```python
import switch

with switch.Switch("ham") as s:
    for case in s.case("spam"):
        #do stuff
    for case in s.default_case():
        #do stuff if no cases matched
```
